        "It is also possible to develop language models at the character level using neural networks. The benefit of character-based language models is their small vocabulary and flexibility in handling any words, punctuation, and other document structure. This comes at the cost of requiring larger models that are slower to train.\n",

        "* I increase the epoch sizes to 500. The accuracy improves from 0.9896 to 0.9948 and the loss decreases from 0.2193 to 0.0092.\n",
        "  * When I set the epoch sizes to 50, the training accuracy is only 0.6120, I think it is because it loses the generalization capacity of the neural network.\n",
        "  * Then I set the epoch sizes to 200, the loss decreases but the training accuracy is slightly lower than the original one. Finally we set the epoch sizes to 500 which is an optimal number of epochs for this model.\n",
        "  * The purpose of tuning epoch sizes is to mitigate overfitting and to increase the generalization capacity of the neural network, so we need to care about the validation loss and accuracy in q2. But the result is great, so we keep the epoch sizes as 500. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* (When I use this model to fit the q2 training set, the validation accuracy is very low, so I go back to q1 and add a mask layer) Then, I added a mask layer and set the mask_value to 1.0, the loss decreases to 0.0090 and the accuracy increases to 0.9948 in all training samples. \n",
        "  * After we split the training and validation set in q2, this model's validation accuracy is 0.9870 which is also pretty good. (loss: 0.0053 - accuracy: 0.9935 - val_loss: 0.1168 - val_accuracy: 0.9870)  \n",
        "  * Why I want to add a mask layer? Because not all samples have a uniform length, the model must be informed that some part of the data is actually padding and should be ignored. So we apply the masking mechanism here.\n",

        "* Then I started exploring what is the effect for different numbers of memory cells in an LSTM, I increased it from 75 to 300. Because my total sequences are around 1785 which are larger this time. It is quite interesting that the validation accuracy is 0.9870 in the first 100 epochs, then it decreases to 0.7403 at my last epoch. So I re-train my model with 100 epochs and get the result: loss: 0.0069 - accuracy: 0.9967 - val_loss: 0.3506 - val_accuracy: 0.9091. It has the higher validation accuracy. Why 500 epochs has worse validation accurancy? I think it is because we overfit the model so that the model is well-trained for our training data but can not have a good performance in our validation set."
